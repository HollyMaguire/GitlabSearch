I left the Gitlab tokin in, I plan on deactivating it after this is viewed. Normally I would add it to a web.config file in the project. Once downloaded it just needs npm install and npm start to get it running. I used apollo to issue the GraphQL queries, I used this simply because it had the most documentation that I found. Then of course there is React and GraphQL as stipulated in the instructions. For what I would have done differently, I was planning on using react tables from material UI but I decided to just use regular html.
